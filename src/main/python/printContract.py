A non-refundable deposit of 25% or [Amount] pesos will be made as an initial deposit and is due on the date that this contract goes into effect. 
The remaining balance of {self.price} pesos shall be due no later than five (5) business days prior to the date of the event. If the balance is not received within this period, an interest rate of 15% of the remaining balance shall be charged for every week the balance is past due.'''

This list may include, but is not limited to, caterers, rental agencies, musicians, DJs, photographers, Videographers, chefs, hotels, and conference centers. Services desired by the Client will be drawn from the approved vendor list when possible. Deviations from this list will be announced to the Client prior to the approval of any final agreement with the vendor. 
The Client is responsible for all payments made to the vendors chosen, and will be notified of all due dates at the time that an agreement is formed with these parties.'''

The Client understands that last-minute changes can affect the quality of the final Event and that these changes are not necessarily the fault of the Event Planner. 
In the event of a cancellation of the Event, the Client should notify the Event Planner no later than thirty (30) days prior to the planned date. Should the Event be canceled after that deadline, the Event Planner may collect the full fee owed, including any applicable interest that may arise due to late payments.'''

In the event of severe weather that may disrupt the Event or prevent it from being held, the Client can propose an alternate date and the Event Planner will make the best effort to accommodate that change as per the clause above.
